   <h2>Part A – Create Basic Website</h2>

   <p>
      Each student will create a website with several web pages that use HTML5, CSS3 and
      images. Students are expected to implement fully functional navigation between the pages.
      You will need to create a website to show case your abilities – an online portfolio of your
      work. The website should consist of several pages with properly implemented navigation
      between them. At a minimum, your website should consist of at least three web pages. You
      are encouraged to have more pages if doing so provides a better user experience.
      When designing and implementing the website, you need to keep the following
      requirements in mind:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>
         Showcase your existing work and, if appropriate, provide narrative for it. Highlight
         your talents and abilities.
      </li>

      <li>
         Project a professional image. Your audience is prospective employers, clients or
         recruitment agents.
      </li>

      <li>
         Provide a method for interested parties to contact you.
      </li>

      <li>
         Your website should work well on a desktop computer with Firefox and Chrome.
      </li>
   </ul>
